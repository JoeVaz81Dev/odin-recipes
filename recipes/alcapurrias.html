            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    In a medium-sized skillet, add the sofrito, salt, bell pepper and sauté for a few minutes. Then add the ground beef and stir to evenly break-up the meat. Let cook until the beef is no longer pink and remove from heat. Set aside and let cool.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Next peel the plantains and the yautía. Use a food processor to grate these ingredients, then mix until a smooth dough forms. Last, add in the seasoning and salt to the dough.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Over a piece of aluminum foil or parchment paper paper, add a toque of oil to grease the surface. Then place a large spoonful of dough onto the foil or paper. Make a well, or small hole in the center and fill with a little stewed meat. Carefully mold the dough to close the hole&mdash;if necessary, you can use more dough for covering.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To cook the finished alcapurrias, pre-heat the oil for frying. Carefully place the molded alcapurrias into the oil and fry for seven minutes on each side, or until golden brown. When ready, set over a paper towel to remove any excess oil.
                </li>
             
            </ol>
